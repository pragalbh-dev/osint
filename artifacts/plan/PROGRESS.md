# PROGRESS — Chanakya OSINT backend build

**The live board.** Any agent reads this (after `CLAUDE.md`) to know where things stand before starting.
**Each session maintains its own row + handoff note inside its PR; you review it with the diff, then merge**
(master §2 Rule 4, §9). A session touches only *its own* row/append, so PRs don't collide. Status ∈
`not-started · in-progress · in-review · merged · blocked`.

## Contract amendments (F0-amendment PRs)
_Post-F0 changes to a frozen contract go here. Each entry: what changed, which contract §, which sessions must rebase._

**MONITOR observable-scope amendment (2026-07-18, branch `f0/observable-watch-instances`):** added an
optional typed field **`watch_instances: list[str] = []`** to `ObservableDef` (master §4.4/§4.6) so an
analyst can watch an **explicit set of resolved entities** (multi-select or a text→observable proposer),
scope = lens ∪ watch_instances. Additive/optional → siblings need no change; **MONITOR/API/frontend**
consume it. Also aligned the golden `alert_delta.json` per-stage fixture from the stray `unit_x` →
`unit_acme` so the seeded `obs-relocation` (subject `lens-acme`, anchor `unit_acme`) actually scopes to
the watched unit; and reconciled the stale `spine/08` §3.10 control-point-5 note ("config-authored, not a
UI") to defer to the `spine/09` in-app define → arm-on-save → fire-on-next-rebuild model. **Board fix:**
corrected stale rows — F0 (merged #1/`7a9e87b`) and DATA-C (merged #8/`407f1c2`).

**Plan-authoring refinements (folded in before F0 is built — no rebase needed):**
- Added **`config/resolution.yaml`** as the 7th config file (merge weights/bands/blocking keys/alias-seed/
  transliteration) — master §4.4/§4.1; authored by DATA-C, schema in F0, consumed by RESOLVE. *(RESOLVE
  flagged the missing home.)*
- Reworded **gate G1** to guard the *rebuild call-path* behaviorally (rebuild runs with the LLM patched to
  raise), not to ban `anthropic` from a stage package — so RESOLVE/INGEST may house an offline proposer/
  extractor in-package. Master §1 invariant #2 + §5 G1. *(RESOLVE/INGEST flagged the tension.)*

**Post-F0 amendments (folded into the owning session's PR; dependents rebase):**
- **`ask()` gains two optional query-time inputs** — frozen entrypoint is now
  `ask(question, view, config, llm=None, claims=None) -> AskAnswer` (was `ask(question, view, config)`).
  Master §4.5. *Both additive & optional* — the existing/planned caller `ask(question, view, config)`
  (**API** session) is unaffected, so no rebase is required.
  - `llm` — the query-time `chanakya.agent.client.LLMClient` seam (mock/recorded in tests, settings-built
    at runtime, keyless → recorded-trace replay). *(user-approved the amendment route over injecting the
    client internally.)*
  - `claims` — a `claim_id → ClaimRecord` lookup. `rebuild()` emits a view that references claims by ID
    only; the record bodies (`kind`, `doc_ref`, source, dates) stay in the evidence log, but `get_evidence`
    (source/date/span) and observed-vs-inferred (from `kind`) need them. **API** passes
    `{c.claim_id: c for c in store.replay()}`. *(ASK call — necessary, additive, API-compatible; the
    view alone cannot cite a source/date/span or tag observed-vs-inferred.)*
  Lands in the **ASK** PR (`feat/ask`); `chanakya/agent/` is ASK-owned, so the edit is in-path — logged
  here per Rule 3 because the *signature* is a contract API reads. *(ASK, 2026-07-18.)*
- **`DocRef.line` + `ClaimRecord.attributes`** (`f0/ingest-schema-slots`, INGEST prep — PR #15) — a nullable
  `line:int` (1-indexed txt line locator, alongside the exact char `span`) on `DocRef`, and a nullable typed
  `attributes:dict` bag on `ClaimRecord` (tier-3 of INGEST's 3-tier attribute promotion: source-native
  context with no ontology home — HS-code/container#/BoL#). Master §4.2. Additive only → Wave-1 siblings pick
  up two new nullable fields on rebase; no code change required. F0 suite (63 tests) green.

**Places + merge-edge amendments (branch `f0/places-and-merge-edges`; dependents rebase onto `main`):**
- **`places` is the 8th loaded config section (`PlacesConfig`)** — master §4.1/§4.4. `config/places.yaml`
  is now served by the live config store (hot-config, `set_section("places", …)`) and consumed by RESOLVE;
  it was previously standalone/unloaded. `ConfigBundle` gains a `.places` field (additive). *(PR
  `f0/places-and-merge-edges`; RESOLVE flagged the gap.)*
- **`Partition` gains `candidates` (HITL-band pairs) + `merge_breakdown` (per-pair score breakdown) +
  `entity_canonical` (raw entity ref → canonical id)**; a `pair_key(a, b)` helper indexes
  `merge_confidence`/`merge_breakdown` — `schemas/stage_io.py`. Additive; the F0 stub still returns them
  empty → golden view byte-identical (G2). *(PR `f0/places-and-merge-edges`.)*
- **`resolve()` signature gains `decisions` (the replayed decision log)** —
  `resolve(claims, config, prev_view=None, decisions=None)`. It is RESOLVE's channel for the offline LLM
  proposer's frozen `merge_proposal` records + analyst `merge_adjudication(accept)`s that grow the alias
  table (spine/03:37 — resolution is a pure function of *evidence log, decision log, config*). Only
  `rebuild()` calls `resolve()`, so no sibling breaks; still LLM-free on the rebuild path (G1). *(PR
  `f0/places-and-merge-edges`.)*
- **`_assemble()` reconnects a merged entity's edges to its canonical node** via
  `Partition.entity_canonical` — edges attach by the *raw* triple subject/object (supersede.py), so a
  merge would otherwise dangle them. Empty map ⇒ identity ⇒ golden unchanged (G2). *(PR
  `f0/places-and-merge-edges`.)*
- **`rebuild()` renders the resolver's decisions as edges** — candidate `same-as` (HITL band) +
  `distinct-from` (both already G4-exempt + ontology-declared), carrying `merge_confidence` + breakdown;
  accepted merges stamp `resolved_from` provenance on the canonical node. Emitted *after* the status
  machine → never scored (G5). master §4.3. **Rebase note:** sessions reading the view (SCORE, MONITOR,
  ASK, API) + in-flight branches rebase onto `main` after this merges — purely additive (new edge types
  + a node attr), no field removed. *(PR `f0/places-and-merge-edges`.)*

## Known build-time reconciliations (F0 / build must resolve — not blockers)
- **F0 location descriptor** must carry `geocode_candidates` + `proposed_alias` so INGEST can freeze
  Nominatim/LLM place proposals onto the ClaimRecord upstream of the append (INGEST flag #1).
  **RESOLVED (already in F0):** `Location` on `main` already carries `geocode_candidates`, `proposed_alias`,
  `wgs84_lat/lon`, `precision_class`, `resolved_place_ref` — no amendment needed; INGEST fills the existing slots.
- **`ClaimRecord.extraction` field naming** — rename the ambiguous `version` → **`model`** (the extraction
  model id) so the frozen contract matches INGEST's `extraction.model`; final shape `{method: llm|vlm, model,
  model_conf}`. One-line F0-amendment, docs-only (backend greenfield). *(DECIDED 2026-07-18; see `md/15` §4 +
  DECISIONS §3; raised as its own F0-amendment PR.)*
  **DEFERRED (INGEST 2026-07-18):** the rename did NOT land on `main` (field is still `version`); renaming
  mid-Wave-1 churns `claim.py` + every consumer for zero demo benefit, so INGEST emits `{method, version,
  model_conf}` (model-id string in `version`) and `version`→`model` becomes a **post-INGEST** cleanup PR — not
  this amendment.
- **Hero-trace edge names** (`ASK`/`EVAL`) — `…imported-by → exported-by → supplies-component` must be
  reconciled against DATA-C's `ontology.yaml` + `answer_key.json`, which are authoritative for exact edge
  names (`C/02` notes the anchor is "to be verified against the generated corpus"). Resolve at DATA-C author
  time; ASK/EVAL bind to whatever the answer_key uses.
  **RESOLVED (DATA-C 2026-07-18):** hero path (traversed battery→origin) is
  `site_karachi ←based-at– unit_paad ←inducted-into– var_hq9p ←equips– comp_ht233 ←manufactures– mfr_casic`
  (canonical edge directions stored origin-ward; traverse bidirectionally). **`equips`** (Component→Variant)
  replaces the overloaded `supplies-component`, now **reserved Manufacturer→Component**. **No `candidate-*`
  edge types** — candidate-ness is a computed edge status (`possible`). Sustainment **split** into
  `techdata_authority` + `interceptor_stockpile`. Dropped `variant-of` (family = Variant attr) + `imported-via`.
  ASK/EVAL bind to these names.
- **`make extract`** is SHIP's Makefile target; INGEST ships only the CLI entrypoint it invokes (INGEST flag #2).

## Handoff notes
_Appended by each session in its PR (stamped with the merge commit at merge). Each entry: what shipped ·
decisions (principle→choice→alternative) · deviations from plan · follow-ups · any gate fixtures added/extended._

### F0 (merged <commit>):

### X0 (merged 0c364be — PR #5): Walking-skeleton deploy
- **Shipped:** self-contained `app_skeleton/` (FastAPI `/health` + minimal Vite placeholder SPA); multi-stage
  `Dockerfile` (`node:20-alpine` builds SPA → `python:3.12-slim` serves it + API); `docker-compose.yml`
  (`restart: unless-stopped`, `127.0.0.1` bind + `APP_PORT` override, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` via `env_file`,
  profile-gated `cloudflared`); `deploy/` (README runbook, `bootstrap-ec2.sh`, `verify.sh`, `prove-live.sh`).
  Public GHCR image `ghcr.io/pragalbh-dev/osint:skeleton` (digest `59cb67c748dd…`).
- **Proven live:** image → GHCR → Docker on EC2 (the moltbot box; Docker installed fresh, moltbot is native so
  untouched) → Cloudflare Tunnel; `/health`=200 and `/` serves the SPA locally, from an anonymous GHCR pull,
  and over a public https tunnel URL. Secret injected via `env_file`, empty in the raw image.
- **Decisions:** build context = `app_skeleton/` (strict ownership; SHIP repoints to repo root) · vanilla-JS
  Vite skeleton (leanest real Node build) · ephemeral `trycloudflare` for the proof + token-tunnel for the
  persistent URL · `APP_PORT` for co-location · `env_file` secret injection (never baked).
- **Deviations:** none (no F0-amendment). Rebased clean onto `main@9f18c07`; deploy merged as #5 (`0c364be`).
  A plan change rode along (Rule 4 flip — sessions maintain `PROGRESS.md` in-PR; primary checkout read-only);
  a merge race meant it landed via a small follow-up PR rather than #5 itself. This row/note is the first
  written under the new rule.
- **Follow-ups (SHIP):** repoint Docker context to repo root; bake `config/`+corpus+seed-SQLite+`backend/`/
  `frontend/`; swap `requirements.txt`→`backend/pyproject.toml`; own `:latest`; rollback drill; token-tunnel
  on the dedicated box for a persistent URL.
- **Gate fixtures:** none (X0 adds no `chanakya/` code; G1–G12 N/A).

### DATA-C (in-review, feat/data-c):
- **Shipped:** the **7 `config/*.yaml`** (ontology/sources/credibility/resolution/templates/subjects/
  observables) — validate + hot-round-trip through F0's config store; generator keyed on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
  only (**G11 green**); **corpus/oracle/text fixes applied + verified** against `answer_key.json`; **F5
  confirmed deep-tier** added under an evidence gate (new doc `d24`); two `tmp/conv/` handoff docs
  (observations + flex-protection changelog).
- **Decisions (principle → choice → alt rejected):**
  - *Answer_key is authoritative + build-it-well* → renamed the overloaded hero edge to **`equips`** (vs
    keeping `supplies-component` overloaded across two node-type pairs); split **sustainment** into two node
    types (vs one merged type that can't carry two freshness classes).
  - *Bi-level, status-is-computed* → **no `candidate-*` edge types**; candidate-ness = edge status `possible`
    (vs baking candidacy into the edge type).
  - *Config-driven, no magic numbers (G6)* → all weights/thresholds/half-lives in `credibility.yaml`;
    integrity tables flattened, gates as an extra `gates:` field (vs hardcoding in SCORE).
  - *Non-negotiable — no fabricated certainty* → F5 confirmed deep-tier only via a source that **directly
    names supplier+component+relationship** (Taian/Wanshan TEL chassis, `d24`), not a bare sanctions listing;
    HT-233 chokepoint kept `candidate`/`UNKNOWN`; 23rd RI/4th Academy kept `possible`.
  - *`source_type` == credibility class* → `sources.yaml source_type` vocabulary matches
    `credibility.source_class_factors` keys (direct R lookup, no mapping layer).
- **Deviations from plan:** none affecting shared contracts (PROGRESS.md in-PR is the standard under the
  updated Rule 4). Full per-fixture **provenance-sidecar system** + the **ingest oracle-boundary guardrail**
  deferred (generator / INGEST scope, documented in the changelog).
- **Follow-ups:** EVAL must confirm the pipeline reaches the oracle's F5-confirmed + equips/split names at
  runtime; **H-200→HT-233 orphan alias** stays OUT of the resolver seed (earn/verify — adaptation demo);
  F7 structural cases (substitutable-by 3-state, MUCD, operational-status) represented-not-instantiated (roadmap).
- **Gate fixtures:** none added (config/corpus session; backend gates untouched, G11 re-verified green).

### MONITOR (in-review, feat/monitor — PR #11):
- **Shipped:** `chanakya/observe/**` — the declarative observable evaluator over `rebuild()` view deltas.
  `evaluate(prev_view, view, config) -> [Alert]` (frozen sig) + `arm()` (arm-on-save read-only pass +
  back-scan) + `explain()` (how an observable compiles — for the config UI / ASK proposer) +
  `read_dispositions()` (reads `alert_disposition` back into per-observable tuning stats). One generic DSL
  (eq/ne/lt/le/gt/ge/exists/not_exists + crossing as a delta mode) with named-`on` sugar → crossing /
  exists / match / **arm-only**, **no per-observable branch**. 40 module tests; full backend suite green
  (103); gates G1–G12 green; ruff + mypy clean.
- **Decisions (principle → choice → alt rejected):** see DECISIONS.md §6 → "MONITOR". Headlines: explicit
  `watch_instances` ∪ lens scope (F0-amend #9); `new_claim` = arm-only (honest boundary — claims aren't in
  the view); match on resolved `edge_instance`/`id` not designators; `fired_ts` left for the API
  (deterministic evaluate); lenient scope fallback (recall bias); disposition = MONITOR consumes / HITL
  writes / config vocabulary / nothing auto-retunes; **location seam built (geofence + "near-a-place"
  scope) but NOT demo-wired** (locked "build seam, roadmap the demo" call, 2026-07-18).
- **Deviations from plan:** none affecting shared contracts. One F0-amendment (#9, merged first): added
  optional `ObservableDef.watch_instances`, aligned the `alert_delta.json` fixture (`unit_x`→`unit_acme`),
  reconciled a stale `spine/08` §3.10 line, corrected the stale board rows (F0/DATA-C → merged).
- **Follow-ups (ASK):** ASK owns **`propose_observable_from_text()`** — free text → an `ObservableDef`
  draft, reusing `find_entity` to resolve named mentions to resolved ids (LLM proposes upstream; analyst
  confirms before arming). MONITOR pre-wired the target (`watch_instances` + `explain()`); this is an ASK
  scope addition, not built here. **(EVAL/roadmap):** wire the location geofence as a roadmap flex; the
  seam + `within_area` primitive are shipped and tested but no geofence observable is in the demo config.
- **Gate fixtures:** none added; extended none. Consumes F0's `per_stage/alert_delta.json` (aligned in #9)
  as the seeded before→after fire fixture. G1 (no network/LLM in `observe/`) + G6 (no scoring literals)
  re-verified green.

### ASK (in-review, feat/ask — PR #14):
- **Shipped:** the cited multi-hop QnA agent as a callable `ask(question, view, config, llm=None, claims=None)
  -> AskAnswer` in `chanakya/agent/` — the 7 deterministic `graph_*` tools (`context.py`+`tools.py`), their
  `strict` JSON schemas with when-NOT-to-use + `input_examples` (`tool_specs.py`), the provider-agnostic LLM
  seam (`client.py`: `LLMClient` protocol · `AnthropicClient` · `ScriptedClient` for offline/recorded),
  the bounded ReAct loop + deterministic fixed hero path (`loop.py`), deterministic answer assembly across
  query shapes (`assemble.py`), the entailment citation validator (`validate.py`), the `ask()` entrypoint,
  and `propose.py` (free text → `ObservableDef` draft — the MONITOR-handoff scope, below).
  **62 agent tests + 2 opt-in `@live`; full suite 165 pass/2 skip (post-rebase on MONITOR #11); ruff + mypy
  + all §5 gates green.**
- **Acceptance met:** hero query traces `based-at → inducted-into → equips → manufactures` citing a real
  claim at each hop; **HT-233 renders CANDIDATE (`substitutability_state=UNKNOWN` → `indeterminate`), never a
  confirmed sole-source**; planted-gap → reasoned insufficiency (`missing_slots` + `next_coverage_due` +
  Known Gap); validator rejects uncited / non-supporting / count-mismatch / not-entailed (mocked judge);
  `find_entity('HQ9P')` fires the "did you mean 'HQ-9/P'?" error; determinism verified (identical `model_dump`).
- **Wide query battery + coverage verdict:** all 10 spine/09 taxonomy shapes exercised (point · 1-hop ·
  multi-hop · filtered · aggregate · status/corroboration · gap · temporal · reverse · ranking) + 2
  adversarial (misspelling → refusal, no wrong bind; "confirmed sole-source?" → INDETERMINATE, absence ≠
  negative). **Every case is answered-with-citations or refused — never fabricated** (`tests/agent/test_battery.py`).
  **Coverage verdict:** the frozen 5-operator + `aggregate` `query_graph` surface over raw + materiality
  attrs served every shape by *composition* — **no surface extension (new operator/attr/tool) was required**.
  *(Added ops `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `in` beyond the spine/09 core `<,≤,=,exists,not_exists` — additive breadth,
  agent-local, no shared-contract change.)*
- **Observable proposer (MONITOR handoff, folded in):** `propose_observable_from_text(text, view, config,
  llm=None) -> ObservableProposal` (`agent/propose.py`) — free text → an `ObservableDef` **draft**. The LLM
  proposes the trigger intent + named mentions (a `draft_observable` structured tool call); `find_entity`
  resolves each mention → `watch_instances` (resolved node ids, **never designator strings**); an
  unresolvable mention is surfaced with its "did you mean" — **never silently wrong-bound**; MONITOR's
  `explain()` is attached for the confirm screen. **Never arms** (`needs_confirmation=True`): the analyst
  confirms, then MONITOR's `arm()`/`evaluate()` take over. Consumes F0-amend #9 (`ObservableDef.watch_instances`)
  + `chanakya.observe.{explain,arm}`; integration-tested against `observe.arm()` (a real cross-session check).
  Closes the ASK follow-up MONITOR handed over (DECISIONS §6 MONITOR).
- **Decisions (principle → choice → alt rejected):**
  - *Testability + keyless boot (invariant #2, §6)* → **F0-amendment**: `ask()` gains optional `llm` + `claims`
    (both additive; API caller unaffected) — see Contract amendments above. Rejected: internal-only client
    construction (un-injectable) / stuffing claims into `view.meta` (bloats `/view`).
  - *Answer_key authoritative (design-authority order)* → hero chain bound to `based-at/inducted-into/equips/
    manufactures`; ASK.md's `imported-by/exported-by/supplies-component` treated as stale.
  - *Non-negotiable — absence ≠ evidence of absence* → chokepoint-honesty fork closed along spine/09's leaning:
    `query_graph` reports matches + a separate `indeterminate` partition; UNKNOWN never counted as a negative.
  - *LLM plans, tools compute (spine/09)* → the answer text is assembled **deterministically from tool
    results** (citations a by-product), not from model prose; the entailment judge validates each assembled
    sentence. Rejected: trusting the LLM's free-form final answer.
  - *Deterministic + offline-testable (§6)* → entailment judge runs only for a live client; ScriptedClient
    (offline/recorded) paths use the deterministic validation part; autouse fixture strips keys for non-`@live`.
- **Deviations from plan:** none affecting shared contracts beyond the logged F0-amendment. `ask()` also
  serves point/1-hop/filter/status/reverse/ranking shapes (assemble builds cited answers from
  `query_graph`/`neighbors`/`get_node`/`get_evidence`, not only `find_paths`) — a capability add, not a
  contract change.
- **Follow-ups:** real-corpus loop-parameter calibration (hop cap / top-k / where LLM-pruning earns its cost)
  is a build-time tune once DATA-C/INGEST land (out of scope here, per ASK.md); the committed **recorded
  hero-trace** (a `ScriptedClient` transcript for keyless replay of the *free-loop* hero, distinct from the
  no-LLM fixed path) is best frozen against the real seeded view at Wave-2 (API/EVAL); API session calls
  `ask(...)` and passes `claims = {c.claim_id: c for c in store.replay()}`.
- **Gate fixtures:** none added/weakened (ASK owns `chanakya/agent/**` + `tests/agent/**`; G1 still green —
  runtime LLM is import-lazy and outside the rebuild call-path).

### HITL (in-review, feat/hitl):
- **Shipped:** the one cross-cutting adjudication service under `backend/chanakya/hitl/` —
  `service.py` (`enqueue` triage-gate + `dispose` analyst path) · `triage.py` (recall-biased
  escalate-vs-auto gate + `order_queue` with ★-pinning and raise-only frozen LLM rank) · `queue.py`
  (envelope builder over F0's `ReviewQueueItem` + transient `ReviewQueue`) · `writeback.py`
  (disposition → appended `DecisionRecord`, deterministic `event_id`, append-only) · `controlpoints.py`
  (all **8** control points catalogued in one service; 3 ★ wired deep — merge/status-override/alert —
  + the built analyst-initiated integrity flag; the other 4 named config/roadmap). 32 tests in
  `tests/hitl/**`; **full suite green (post-rebase on ASK #14 / MONITOR #11), ruff + mypy clean.**
- **Decisions (principle → choice → alt rejected):** see `DECISIONS.md` §6 "HITL". Headlines:
  - *Demo-reliability / don't fork a shared contract* → **`reject` = forced demote (`set_status→probable`),
    no F0-amendment** *(user 2026-07-18)*; the claim-exclusion machine-recompute is deferred to EVAL.
  - *Structural propagation (G12)* → **writeback only appends; `rebuild()` applies `effects`** (no per-stage
    fan-out).
  - *G1/G2* → **disposing path has no LLM/network/clock/RNG**; `event_id` derived from (item, option), `ts`
    supplied; the triage-rank LLM is offline/frozen/replayed (data, never a live call). `chanakya/hitl`
    imports no `anthropic`/`httpx`/`requests` (asserted in-test).
  - *Recall ≈ 1.0* → **auto-proceed only on positive safety on all of confidence/materiality/novelty**;
    any unknown escalates. ★ pinning + no-drop/no-inject enforced structurally in `order_queue`.
  - *Config-driven, minimal amendment surface* → **`TriageConfig` is HITL-owned + overridable**, not a new
    shared config section.
- **Deviations from plan:** (1) `reject` scoped to forced-demote (above) — session acceptance #1's
  machine-recompute deferred. (2) Integrity flag propagates at the **element** level via F0's existing
  `add_integrity_flag` (co-referring claims share one element) + carries a `flag_origin` intent; true
  per-claim + *future-claim* origin fan-out is SCORE's (a monitoring-grade gap, flagged for EVAL). **No
  F0-amendment; no shared-contract change; no frozen-file edits.**
- **Follow-ups (EVAL):** re-verify end-to-end once SCORE lands — (a) reject→confirmed→probable via the real
  status machine, (b) integrity origin fan-out across claims/future claims. Effect shapes HITL emits for
  siblings: `grow_alias`/`record_distinct`/`split_merge` (RESOLVE) · `set_status` (SCORE) ·
  `tune_tripwire` (MONITOR) · `add_integrity_flag`+`flag_origin` (SCORE).
- **Gate fixtures:** extended G12 coverage lives in `tests/hitl/test_acceptance.py` (F0's
  `tests/gates/test_g12_*` untouched and green); no gate weakened.
- **Board note:** F0/DATA-C rows read stale at branch time (F0 `not-started`, DATA-C `in-review`) though
  both were merged (PR #1/#8); left others' rows untouched per Rule 4 — the amendment PR #9 has since
  corrected them, picked up on rebase.
