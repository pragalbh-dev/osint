"""Canonical edge direction — one house convention per relationship type (INGEST canonical-edge-direction,
2026-07-19; ``tmp/conv/INGEST-canonical-edge-direction-at-write.md``).

**The silent failure this fixes.** Two claims corroborate only when they land on the **same graph edge**,
and an edge is keyed by its resolved ``(subject, predicate, object)`` triple (``resolve``'s ``edge_instance``
and ``view.supersede.build_instance_edges``). So two claims of *one fact* written with subject and object
**flipped** — "HQ-9 at Rahwali" vs. "Rahwali hosts HQ-9" — become two different edges and never corroborate,
silently, with both claims looking fine on their own. The text lane, the imagery inference, and even two
independent LLM extractions of one sentence can each orient an edge differently.

**The fix.** Write every relationship claim in **one canonical direction per relationship type**, so every
producer (text extraction, the imagery inference, anything added later) emits a given edge the same way; then
co-location just works and the append-only log is internally consistent. The ontology already declares each
relationship's direction — this module reads that declaration, promoted from a human ``# Unit->Site`` comment
to machine-readable ``from:``/``to:`` fields on each edge ``TypeDef`` (``ConfigModel`` is ``extra="allow"``,
so these are plain YAML fields — no F0 schema change) — and orients a claim's endpoints to match.

**Two placements, one function** (belt + suspenders):

* **write-side** — the INGEST lane runs :func:`canonicalize_claims` per document (over that doc's own entity
  claims + the place gazetteer) before dedup, so what is *appended to the immutable log* is already correct.
* **read-side net** — ``rebuild()`` runs it again over all active claims, as a fallback for any producer that
  could not type its endpoints at write-time (or predates the convention). It reorients only the *derived
  view* — it never rewrites the log.

**Pure & deterministic (gates G1/G2):** no network, clock, or RNG; the same ``(claims, config)`` always yields
the same orientation. The module **never guesses** — a symmetric/structural edge (``same-as``, ``corroborates``,
``supersedes``, …), a same-type edge (``component-of``), a triple whose object is a structured value, or a
triple whose endpoints cannot be typed is returned exactly as written. It is a **no-op** on an ontology that
declares no edge directions (the golden test fixtures), so those views stay byte-identical.
